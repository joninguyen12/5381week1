## 👥 Main Characters

### Harry Potter

The series’ protagonist and “the Boy Who Lived.” Orphaned as a baby when Lord Voldemort killed his parents, Harry grows up with the Dursleys until he learns he is a wizard and is invited to Hogwarts. He is brave, loyal, and willing to sacrifice himself for others. His destiny is tied to defeating Voldemort.

### Hermione Granger

Harry’s best friend and one of the brightest witches of her year. Hermione is known for her intelligence, dedication to rules and research, and quick thinking in danger. She often finds the answers in books and logic and is fiercely loyal to Harry and Ron.

### Ron Weasley

Harry’s other best friend and the Weasley family’s youngest son. Ron provides humour and heart; he sometimes feels overshadowed by his famous friend and his successful siblings but proves his courage and loyalty repeatedly. He is a key member of the trio.

### Albus Dumbledore

Headmaster of Hogwarts and one of the greatest wizards of the age. Dumbledore acts as mentor and guide to Harry, offering wisdom and protection while keeping some secrets until the right time. He is a symbol of goodness and sacrifice in the fight against Voldemort.

### Lord Voldemort

The main antagonist, a dark wizard who seeks immortality and pure-blood dominance. Born Tom Riddle, he split his soul into Horcruxes and led two wizarding wars. His fear of death and prophecy about Harry drive the central conflict of the series.

### Severus Snape

Hogwarts Potions master (and later Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher). Snape appears cold and hostile to Harry but is one of the story’s most complex figures. His past, his loyalties, and his actions are gradually revealed and change how readers view him.
